Smartspacer is a customisable widget for Android, but with a difference: It can upgrade the built in At a Glance on Pixels - without root!

## Features

- Drop-in At a Glance replacement, while keeping existing At a Glance functionality
- Upgrades built in At a Glance on the lock & home screens on Pixels (requires Shizuku)
- Widget compatible with any launcher, showing all At a Glance content - even on third party launchers
- Extensive plugin system, to pull in data from loads of apps
- Plugin Repository in-app, for easy plugin downloads
- AI-esque requirements system, to make information shown more dynamic - want to show your gym pass at the gym or your loyalty card and shopping list at the store? Smartspacer can do that.
- Full screen "Expanded Smartspace", showing you all of Smartspacer at once, with dynamic widgets and shortcuts. Available as a Google Discover replacement for compatible launchers.
- "OEM Smartspace" support for devices still using the legacy At a Glance implementation
