### Q: Does Smartspacer need root?
A: To use the Smartspacer widget with no integration, root is never required. However, if you want to use enhanced mode, which integrates with the system where available, you will need either Shizuku/ADB (Android 12+) or root (Android 10-11)
### Q: Why do I need to reconnect Smartspacer every reboot, when using Native Smartspace?
A: This is due to the method used to replace the system Smartspace service, while maintaining the original service (also known as At a Glance). While it would be possible to set Smartspacer as the default on a rooted device with an overlay, it would break compatibility with At a Glance, so the preferred method is to simply require a one-tap setup per reboot.
### Q: I want to use Smartspacer as a Google Discover (minus one) replacement, how do I do this?
A: Currently, to use it on release versions of launchers, you have to use Discover Killer, which requires root. However, there is a test version of Lawnchair with the functionality replaced (no root needed), and it may eventually be merged into Lawnchair's mainline builds. Nova Launcher 8 allows you to choose between either Google Discover or Smartspacer (no root needed). Other launchers may also add it as an option in the future too.
### Q: How do I report a bug?
A: Open an issue, using the Bug Report option. 
### Q: Where can I get Smartspacer plugins?
A: In the Plugins tab of the app, there are a number of available plugins. If you have an idea for a plugin which may work, request it at https://github.com/KieronQuinn/SmartspacerPlugins/issues
### Q: I'm using a device with OEM Smartspace, but it doesn't work
A: Check the [OEM Smartspace](https://github.com/KieronQuinn/Smartspacer/wiki/1:-OEM-Smartspace) page
